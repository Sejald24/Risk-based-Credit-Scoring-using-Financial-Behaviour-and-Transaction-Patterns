**Objective:**
Developed a machine learning model to predict credit risk categories (Low, Medium, High) based on financial behavior and transaction patterns.
**Data Preprocessing:**
-Cleaned the dataset by removing null values, duplicates, and outliers.
-Performed log transformation on skewed features and label encoding for categorical target variables.
-Imbalance Handling: Applied SMOTE to balance the dataset and improve model performance on minority classes.
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
-Analyzed patterns in features to identify key trends.
-Visualized feature relationships with the target variable to uncover insights.
**Modeling:**
-Built and evaluated classification models: Random Forest, XGBoost, and SVC.
-Achieved highest accuracy of 77.7% with XGBoost.
**Evaluation:**
-Generated classification reports to assess precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
-Compared model performances to select the best approach for deployment.
**Tools & Techniques:**
-Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SMOTE, XGBoost,RandomForest,SVC
